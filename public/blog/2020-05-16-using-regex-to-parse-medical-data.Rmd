One of the very difficult parts of data analytics is usually not the actual statistical analysis of large datasets, but rather attempting to properly wrangle the data into formats that are more easily transformable. Here are a few tips to get you started:

I personally feel that the most important tools you will ever use are in the basic packages of Python itself. Though packages such as regex, numpy, and pandas are all important to making sure that your data is ported into a form that you can actually use for massive calculations, an important part to consider first is how to get there. 
Take for example this sentence:

```{python}
sentence = "Hello my name is my mother's name, which is also my father's name, which was almost my brother's name, and now is my name"
```

I repeated the word "my" many times to illustrate part of my point; Often times important datapoints will be included with other datapoints, making it difficult to easily discern the important parts. However there are options which can help.

First off, I want to talk about str.split() and str.strip(). These functions are so universal in their capabilities. For example in this case, you can use str.split() like so to chop up the sentence and get the data you need, and str.strip to get rid of all extraneous spacing:
```{python}
sentence = "Hello my name is my mother's name, which is also my father's name, which was almost my brother's name, and now is my name"
sections = sentence.strip()
sections = sections.split()
print(sections)
```
And as you can see you can then easily find the number of times "my"" shows up in the sentence

```{python}
sentence = "Hello my name is my mother's name, which is also my father's name, which was almost my brother's name, and now is my name"
sections = sentence.strip()
sections = sections.split()
print(sections)

line = 'my'
i = 0
for sect in sections:
  if sect == line:
    i+=1

print(i)
```
And by using a for loop and the "in" factor, you can easily find out the number of times this word shows up. This can have many applications, and can even be reformatted for going line-by-line within a large text file to glean certain otherwise missed facts about the dataset you're attempting to gain information about.
